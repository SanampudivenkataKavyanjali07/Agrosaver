This project aims to offer an affordable  solution to protect crops, especially in rural areas where farmers  not have immediate access to complex security systems. The goal is to increase crop yield ,improve farming practices with help of AI.  Iâ€™m excited about this project  combines AI, ml, and IoT to make a real-world impact in the agriculture.
