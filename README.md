# Agrosaver
This project aims to offer an affordable  solution to protect crops, especially in rural areas where farmers  not have immediate access to complex security systems. The goal is to increase crop yield ,improve farming practices with help of AI.  I’m excited about this project  combines AI, ml, and IoT to make a real-world impact in the agriculture.AgroSaver: AI-Based Animal Detection System for Agriculture

As part of my ongoing project, I’ve developed AgroSaver, an AI-powered system aimed at protecting agricultural fields from unwanted animals, specifically rats and snakes. This system uses computer vision to detect the presence of animals in agricultural fields, helping to prevent damage to crops.

KEY FEATURES:

Animal Detection: Utilizes machine learning models to recognize and differentiate between cats and snakes.

Real-time Alerts: Integrated with an Arduino setup that triggers an audio signal—one beep for a cat and two beeps for a snake—to alert farmers immediately.

Custom YOLO Model: I trained a YOLOv8 model using a dataset of rat images for accurate and efficient detection.


TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Python for machine learning model development.

YOLOv8 for object detection.

Arduino for hardware integration and signal generation.
